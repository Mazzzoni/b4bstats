# Weapons

This directory contains every data related to weapons statistics, you can find every rarity in their respective directory.

# Attachments

Attachments for weapons are also declared, we only specify those that can influence weapons (no move speed stock for example), so those can be simulated on/off for each weapon and see their statistics adjusted in real time.
